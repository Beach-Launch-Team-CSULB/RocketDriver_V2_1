//That would have to be with pointers specifically to my set functions somehow
//This should work, but even if it does I need nested maps. Inner map is the key to find the right function pointer for an object, outer map is to grab the right map for an object.



//the shittier version is to just make switch cases for each class based on the settingID
//would need to map the objectIDs to the right class, and have a stupid switch function for the class manually coded
