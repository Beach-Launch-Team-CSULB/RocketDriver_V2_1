// It IS CONRIFMED possible to get over 1000000 microseconds as the value for the second, but maybe by only 1 or so due to the clock cycle turn over inside this function
// Use a round up function that adds a second to the polled time and subtracts 1000? I guess it depends on the order, seconds would be ticked over if they were called after this and then just subtract 1000
